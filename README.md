<div style="font-size: 1.2em; line-height: 1.6;">

### Overview
This project is part of the **CSE 107: Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) Lab** course.  
It involves designing and implementing a **Player Management System** using Java to handle 
player details and persist them in a file. The project emphasizes OOP principles and file operations.

### Features
<ul>
  <li><b>Player Class:</b> Stores player details, such as name, country, age, height, club, position, jersey number, and weekly salary.</li>
  <li><b>toString Method:</b> Formats player information into a readable string for display or debugging purposes.</li>
  <li><b>File Handling:</b> Writes player details to a CSV file, ensuring each record starts on a new line for proper organization.</li>
  <li><b>Error Handling:</b> Robust mechanisms to catch and report file operation errors.</li>
</ul>

### Learning Outcomes
This project demonstrates practical applications of OOP principles, including encapsulation and class design.  
Additionally, it provides hands-on experience with file I/O operations in Java and highlights the importance 
of clean, maintainable, and efficient code.
